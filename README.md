# Advisory Angels

### Problem Statement 
Current advisory offerings provide basic guidance on stock prices, entry and exit points, and time horizons. However, clients often need more detailed explanations to make informed investment decisions confidently. Questions such as “Why this prediction?” or “How was this conclusion reached?” remain unanswered, limiting client understanding. Additionally, users face challenges in navigating complex financial data, market sentiment, and news analysis, which can make the advisory process less user-friendly. There is a gap in providing personalized, comprehensible insights that also facilitate clients in setting financial goals based on their risk appetite and objectives.

### Solution
We propose creating Advisory Angels, an AI-powered advisory assistant that integrates with ChatGPT or similar advanced conversational AI. This tool will function as an interactive, user-friendly chatbot that answers client queries regarding investment advice. Advisory Angels would allow users to delve deeper into advisory data, offering explanations and insights that go beyond basic metrics, while also providing goal-setting support.
The chatbot will cover various aspects:

* Explanation of Predictions: Offer easy-to-understand explanations of why specific predictions were made, covering factors like stock or derivative fundamentals and recent trends.
* Time Horizon Insights: Help clients understand the rationale behind recommended investment time horizons.
* Conclusion Logic: Explain how advisory conclusions on price targets were reached, detailing the underlying data and analytical process.
* Similar Stock Suggestions: Recommend stocks with similar attributes based on user-selected parameters.
* Simplified Performance Data: Present performance data in an easily digestible format without requiring users to navigate complex charts or reports.
* News Summaries and Sentiment: Aggregate relevant news and offer summarized insights; analyze market sentiment using historical Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) and Domestic Institutional Investor (DII) activity data.
* Contrarian Investing Suggestions: Provide ideas for contrarian investors by suggesting stocks that deviate from mainstream market picks, based on specific analytical insights.
* Portfolio Integration: Integrate users’ existing portfolios to offer tailored advice based on current holdings.
* Financial Goal Guidance: Assist users in setting financial goals by factoring in target investment areas (equity, mutual funds, bonds, gold, etc.), available funds, and risk tolerance to provide personalized recommendations.
